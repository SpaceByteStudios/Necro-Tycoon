# Necro Tycoon - Pixel Game Jam 2025
My game jam submission made in the Godot Engine v4.4.1 for the Pixel Game Jam - 2025

The theme was *From the dead*. So I made a **Tycoon Game** where you have to build a rail network to transport skeletons and resources to different locations, to generate money!

Play the game here:

Use the code in whatever way you want :)!
